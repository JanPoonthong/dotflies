Strager: It's complicated. My current thinking is that OOP
requires polymorphism. If you're using classes without
polymorphism, I don't consider that OOP.

Polymorphism: It describes the concept that objects of different types
can be accessed through the same interface. Each type can
provide its own, independent implementation of this interface.

Pygame:

    pygame.key.set_repeat(delay, interval) -> None

When the keyboard repeat is enabled, keys that are held down
will generate multiple pygame.KEYDOWN events. The dalay is
the number of milliseconds before the first repeated
pygame.KEYDOWN will be send. After that another
pygame.KEYDOWN will be send every interval milliseconds

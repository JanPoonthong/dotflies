* Yeah but until you understand how you can break problems down into code, 
you can't know how to design
* Two things - the skills to implement your idea,
and the skill to break your idea down in a way you can implement it
* Problem solving and analysis skills

Anything you learn has to be remembered otherwise you wasted your own time, so I aim for complete recall for anything I learn.

My (current) 5 step process(This process is meant to be used on every little concept you encounter, not whole paragraphs, not whole topics, every tiny little bit of information gets its own timer.):
1. I make sure that I properly understand the concept/fact/process that I am trying to learn (use as many of your senses as possible, make the concept as absurd as you can, smell it, feel it, etc)  and note it down in my own words without looking at the source of information. If it seems like I can't explain it simply enough, it means I don't understand it good enough so I try to understand it better.
1. I set a 20 mins timer that reminds me to review what I just learned, since the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve tells us that 40% of your knowledge is lost within 20 mins. If I have perfect recall after this the timer goes off I go to the next step.

1. I do the same as the previous step but then with a 6 hour timer.

1. After successive recall of your concept I put my concept in Anki (A free spaced repetition program) with my specific settings
 (my settings: https://tinyurl.com/yc5rrz9u)
 (In Anki there are a few options when you get your card. NEVER EVER click on 'easy'. It fucks up your learning curve)
1. If you followed all these steps you should theoretically have perfect recall and never forget what you just learned. If you are fail to perfectly recall the concept during any of the Anki repetitions then relearn the concept and it'll have an ever stronger foundation.

HOW DO I GO THROUGH BOOKS/TEXTBOOKS?

My 2 step process:

1. First we go through the whole book, reading it carefully and using highlights/screenshotting any useful part to distinguish fluff (useless stuff) to actual decent material. This should technically reduce the length of your book by about 90% when you're done. It also gives you the advantage that you 'prime' your brain for the material, which means that in the next step it will never be the first time that you've seen/read whatever you are reading.

1. Now start at the start again(or go through your storage of 'snips') and ignore ALL the fluff, use my method that I described above to add all necessary information to memory. This might seem like it will take a long time, but consider how many times you'll have to reread the book if you always forget what you read before.

There is no secret sauce, kids. Greatness is not profound; it is simple. It’s discipline, structure, and a self-motivated mindset to get you where you want to be. - conor

strager: If you want to be an entrepreneur, you have a terrible mindset. Entrepreneurs lead;
they don't follow. Entrepreneurs find problems; they don't chase solutions.
Entrepreneurs think "Is it profitable to solve problem X? Let's research problem X
and its market demand."; they don't think "Is it profitable do do skill Y? Let me
ask people about skill Y and its market demand. Entrepreneurs are the people who
hire 9-5 workers, so they cannot have the same mindset as 9-5 workers.

I would say the most important problem that world is facing
is sustainable energy and multi-planet species.

The way we could move to sustainable energy is through 
solar and electric vehicle.

If we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness then
we'll better be able to answer the ask question and
understand why we're here or what's all about and so we
should sort of taking the set of actions that are mostly
likely to result in understanding what question to ask about
the nature of the universe so therefore we must propagate a
human civilization on earth as far into the future as
possible and become multi-planet species to again extend the
scope and scale of consciousness and increase their probable
the life span of consciousness and machine consciousness in the
future that's the best we can do basically.

Think about the various problems that we're facing or what
would most likely changed the future.

The **INTERNET** would fundamentally change humanity
The **AI**
The **Sustainable energy**

Existential crisis -> Meaning of life, purpose, or value.
what's the world mean?

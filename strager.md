strager: If you want to be an entrepreneur, you have a terrible mindset. Entrepreneurs lead;
they don't follow. Entrepreneurs find problems; they don't chase solutions.
Entrepreneurs think "Is it profitable to solve problem X? Let's research problem X
and its market demand."; they don't think "Is it profitable do do skill Y? Let me
ask people about skill Y and its market demand. Entrepreneurs are the people who
hire 9-5 workers, so they cannot have the same mindset as 9-5 workers.

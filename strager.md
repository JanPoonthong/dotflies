	If you want to be an entrepreneur, you have a terrible mindset. Entrepreneurs lead; they don't follow. Entrepreneurs find problems; they don't chase solutions. Entrepreneurs think "Is it profitable to solve problem X? Let's research problem X and its market demand."; they don't think "Is it profitable do do skill Y? Let me ask people about skill Y and its market demand.". Entrepreneurs are the people who hire 9-5 workers, so they cannot have the same mindset as 9-5 workers.

# The Pragmatic Programmer 

### What makes a pragamatic programmer?
* Early adopter/fast adapter: You love to try things out and quick learner
* Inquisitive: You tend to ask questions. That's neat---how
  did you do that? Did you have problems with that library?
What's this BeOS I've heard about? How are symbolic links
implemented? You are a pack rat for little facts, each of
which may effect some decision years from now.
* Critical thinker: You rerely take things as given without
  first getting the facts. When colleagues say "because that's 
the way it's done," or a vendor promises the solution to all 
your problems, you smell a challenge.
* Realistic: You try to understand the underlying nature of
  each problem you face. This realism gives you a good feel 
for how difficult things are, and how long things will take.
Understanding for yourself that a process should be difficult or will take a
while to complete gives you the stamina to keep at it.
* Jack of all trades. You try hard to be familiar with a broad range of technologies
and environments, and you work to keep abreast of new developments. Although
your current job may require you to be a specialist, you will always be able to move
on to new areas and new challenges.

# The Pragmatic Programmer 

### What makes a pragamatic programmer?
* Early adopter/fast adapter: You love to try things out and
quick learner

* Inquisitive: You tend to ask questions. That's neat---how
  did you do that? Did you have problems with that library?
What's this BeOS I've heard about? How are symbolic links
implemented? You are a pack rat for little facts, each of
which may effect some decision years from now.

* Critical thinker: You rerely take things as given without
  first getting the facts. When colleagues say "because that's
the way it's done," or a vendor promises the solution to all
your problems, you smell a challenge.

* Realistic: You try to understand the underlying nature of
  each problem you face. This realism gives you a good feel
for how difficult things are, and how long things will take.
Understanding for yourself that a process should be difficult
or will take a while to complete gives you the stamina to
keep at it.

* Jack of all trades. You try hard to be familiar with a
broad range of technologies and environments, and you work
to keep abreast of new developments. Although your current
job may require you to be a specialist, you will always be
able to move on to new areas and new challenges.

### Tips
1. Care about your craft: We feel that there is no point in
developing software unless you care about doing it well.

1. Think! about your work: Think about what you're doing
while you're doing it, go deep, understand the fundamental
how things works. Never run on auto-pilot. This is going to
take up some of your valueable time. The reward is a more
active involvement with a job you love, a feeling of mastery
over an increasing range of subjects, and pleasure in a
feeling of continuous improvement.

1. Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses

### It's a continuous process
Great lawns need small amount of daily care, and so do great
programmers. "Kaizen" is a Janpanese term that captures the
concept of continously making many small improvements. It
was considered to be one of the main reason for the dramtic
gain in productivity and quality in Janpanese manufacturing
and was widely copied throughout the world. Kaizen applies
to individuals, too. Every day, work to refine the skills
you have and add new tools to your repertoire. you'll start
seeing results in a matter of days. Over the years, you'll
be amazed at how your experience has blossomed and your
skilss have grown.

## Chapter 1. A pragmatic philosophy
* They think beyond the immediate problem.
* Always trying to place it in it's latger context.
* Always trying to be aware of the bigger picture.
* They take responsibility for everything they do
* Communicate

#### The cat ate my source code
* Taking responsibility for they own actions and projects
* When you make mistake (as we all do) or an error in
  judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.
* Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an
  excuse

#### Software entropy

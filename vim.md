# Vim

To enable clipboard and xtermclipboard on vim ```sudo apt install vim-gtk```

To compile from source code, I need ```sudo apt install libncurses-dev```

vim:```:saveas # Renamed the file```

vim: ```~ # Capitalize the character```

vim: ```%s/<word>/<word>/c # For conforming every
substitute```
